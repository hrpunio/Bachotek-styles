Modified TUGproc macros for paper submissions (in Polish) 
to Polish TeX Users Group (GUST) conference.

Papers in English should be prepared with standard ltugproc.cls/tugproc.sty 
macros. Bothe plain and latex macros are accepted, however the later (latex) 
are  preferred. 
The macros can be found at http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/location.html
